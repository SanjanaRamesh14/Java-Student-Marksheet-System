ðŸ“˜ Java Student Marksheet Management System

This is a simple Java console application that takes user input for student names and their subject-wise marks, calculates total marks, and displays a sorted mark sheet with ranks. The data is sorted in descending order based on total marks using bubble sort.

ðŸ’¡ Features

Accepts any number of students and subjects.

Uses Scanner for real-time user input.

Calculates total marks for each student.

Sorts students based on their total score (rank-wise).

Outputs a clear, structured mark sheet for each student.
